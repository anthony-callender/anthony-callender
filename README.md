Hey there, I'm Anthony Callender, a dedicated Data Scientist with a focus on Business Analytics and Machine Learning. Across more than 13 technical projects, I've honed my skills in Optimization, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and crafting predictive ML models using Python, SQL, ML, and DL techniques.

My passion lies in the intersection of data and finance. Currently, I'm engrossed in constructing a minimum viable trading bot that forecasts institutional price movements—an exciting venture in the finance domain.

While my professional journey includes over a year of freelance web development work with one brand and two companies using WordPress, my collaboration with a graphic designer in these projects enriched my problem-solving, communication, and critical thinking abilities, crucial skills in any business context.

My educational background includes graduating from TripleTen's rigorous 10-month Data Science program in November 2022, where I obtained a comprehensive certificate in Data Science, diving deep into advanced analytical techniques.

I'm excited to apply my expertise in data-driven decision-making to the dynamic world of finance. Feel free to explore my repositories to delve deeper into my projects and endeavors!
