Hey there, I'm Anthony Callender, a dedicated Data Scientist with a focus on Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Across more than 13 technical projects, I've honed my skills in Optimization, Clustering, NLP, and crafting predictive ML models using Python, SQL, ML, and DL techniques.

I consider myself a digital polytmath with a passion to learn everything about everything, particualy anything related to: Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Philosophy, Psychology, Theology, Economics, Finance, Business, etc.

While my professional journey includes over 2 years of freelance web development work with a professional boxer and multiple B2B businesses using WordPress, my collaboration with an edtech startup Kippy.ai, provided me with the opportunity to inmerse myself in the self-improvement and education industry. I conducted user segmentation analysis using various clustering techniques to create detailed user profiles. These profiles assist in personalizing the application and enhancing marketing strategies. I collaborated with a data team to perform in-depth analysis of application data, employing natural language processing (NLP) to extract unique insights and personality traits from user messages.

My educational background includes graduating from TripleTen's rigorous 10-month Data Science program in November 2022, where I obtained a comprehensive certificate in Data Science, diving deep into advanced analytical techniques.

I'm excited to apply my expertise in data-driven decision-making to the dynamic world of finance. Feel free to explore my repositories to delve deeper into my projects and endeavors!
